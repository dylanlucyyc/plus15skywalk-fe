        <p>
          The +15 Skywalk is a network of elevated, enclosed walkways in
          downtown Calgary that connects office buildings, shopping centers, and
          other facilities. Named for being approximately 15 feet above street
          level, it spans over 18 kilometers, making it one of the largest
          pedestrian skywalk systems in the world. It's designed to help people
          move around the city center comfortably, especially during Calgary’s
          harsh winters.
